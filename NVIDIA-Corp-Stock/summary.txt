The purpose of this was to showcase that we cant run a linear regression model if feature variables are not independent and have relationship between each other. 
In this case all feature variables are dependent with each other except "volume". When we only use "volumne" as a feature, our model doesnt perform well. 
We cant explain the variance in data by just looking at volume.
